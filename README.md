# Development Setup

Prerequisites:

- Elixir 1.14+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Make
- Openai key

Quick Start:

```bash
make dev
```

If setup hasn't been completed before, make dev will go through the setup process.

The script will prompt you for an openai key and add it to the generated .env file.
